# R-EDA-WEEK1-R
The goal of this analysis is to identify individuals who are most likely to click on a cryptography course advertisement. This project uses R for analysis



**Defining the Metric for Success**

The project will be considered a success when we are able to clean and analyse past data to segment blog users and identify individuals who should be targeted for an advertisement


***Context***



An entreperneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She has employed my services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ad
